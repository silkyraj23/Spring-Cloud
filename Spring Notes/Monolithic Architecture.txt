Monolithic Architecture
A monolithic architecture is a software design pattern where the entire application is developed as a single, unified unit.

Key Characteristics:
Single Codebase – The whole application is built using one code repository.
Unified Deployment – The complete application is packaged and deployed together.
Tightly Coupled Components – All modules are interconnected, making modifications challenging.
Shared Resources – The system uses a single database and memory space.
Simplified Development & Deployment – Easier to develop, test, and deploy compared to distributed architectures.


Advantages:
Simplified Development – Suitable for small-scale applications.
Easy Deployment – No complex service orchestration is needed.
Centralized Data Handling – One database manages all data, reducing inconsistencies.

Disadvantages:
Scalability Issues – Difficult to scale specific modules independently.
High Maintenance Complexity – A minor change in one part may affect the entire system.
Technology Constraints – Introducing new technologies often requires major refactoring.
Deployment Challenges – Larger applications become difficult to manage and deploy.

Ideal Use Cases:
 Small-scale applications.
 Rapid development and prototyping.
 Teams with fewer developers.
