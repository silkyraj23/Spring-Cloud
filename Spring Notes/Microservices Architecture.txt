Microservices Architecture
Microservices architecture is a software development approach where an application is broken down into multiple independent services. Each service handles a distinct business function and communicates with others through well-defined APIs.

Core Principles:
Single Responsibility – Each service focuses on a specific task.
Independence – Services operate autonomously.
Loose Coupling – Minimal dependencies between services.
Resilience – Built-in fault tolerance mechanisms.
Autonomous Data Management – Each service manages its own data independently.
Benefits:
Highly Scalable – Individual components can scale separately.
Resilient to Failures – System remains operational even if one service fails.
Technology Agnostic – Different services can be built with different technologies.
Faster Development – Teams can work on separate services simultaneously.
✔ Easier Maintenance – Updates can be deployed to individual services without affecting others.
✔ Flexible Deployment – Supports containerization and cloud-native development.

Ideal Scenarios for Use:
Large-scale applications with complex functionality.
Organizations where multiple teams manage different modules.
Systems requiring integration with numerous third-party services.
Applications that demand high availability and failure resilience.

Challenges to Consider:
 Increased Complexity – Managing multiple services introduces additional dependencies.
 Network Overhead – More API calls can lead to higher latency.
 Data Consistency Issues – Synchronizing distributed transactions is difficult.
 Security Risks – Multiple endpoints create a larger attack surface.
